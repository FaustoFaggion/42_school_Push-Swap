# Push-Swap Project
## Description
<p> The Push_swap project is a very simple and highly effective algorithm project: data will
need to be sorted. You have at your disposal a set of int values, 2 stacks and a set of
instructions to manipulate both stacks. </p>
<p> Your goal is to write a program in C called push_swap which calculates and displays
on the standard output the smallest program using Push_swap instructions that
sorts the integer arguments received. </p>
<p>Instructions</p>
<ul>
<li>sa - swap the first two numbers on stack A</li>
<li>sb - swap the first two numbers on stack B</li>
<li>ss - runs sa and sb instructions at the same time</li>
<li>ra - take the the number on the top of stack A and shift to the last position</li>
<li>rb - take the the number on the top of stack B and shift to the last position</li>
<li>rr - runs ra and rb instructions at the same time</li>
<li>rra - take the the number on the botton of stack A and shift to the top position</li>
<li>rrb - take the the number on the botton of stack B and shift to the top position</li>
<li>rr - runs rra and rrb instructions at the same time</li>
<li>pa - push the number on the top of stack B to the top of stack A</li>
<li>pb - push the number on the top of stack A to the top of stack B</li>
<li>pp - runs pa and pb instructions at the same time</li>
</ul>
